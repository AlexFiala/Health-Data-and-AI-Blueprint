# Pre GA DEPLOYMENT
## PLEASE DO NOT FORK, OR PROVIDE BUGS IN GIT 
## CONTACT frasim@microsoft.com WITH ANY ISSUES, OR CHANGES


## To run the solution please review requirements:

1. Must have a subscription where you have access and can manage the GLOBAL ADMIN. 

 **FOR MSFT EMPLOYEES - Subscriptions can be set up using ARIS - https://azuremsregistration.cloudapp.net/Request.aspx**
-  You must select - External test or External Demo for access to a DS that is not associated with MSFT Domain.
- ALSO NOTE THAT RUNNING THIS SCRIPT FROM HOST ON MSFT WILL FAIL, DUE TO MSFT FIREWALL RULES.


2. Follow the **[deployment instructions](./AzureHealthDocs.md) **


I've also posted a video and blueprint deck you can view on how the solution works, and what you can expect when deploying it.
